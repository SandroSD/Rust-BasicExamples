# Rust-BasicExamples

Welcome to the Rust Basic Examples repository! This repository contains two fundamental projects that I created to deepen my understanding of Rust programming. These projects cover essential Rust concepts and demonstrate practical applications of the language.

## Projects

### 1. Calculator

The Calculator project is a simple command-line application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It covers the following topics:

- **Enums**: Using enums to define different operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
- **Structs**: Creating and using structs to encapsulate data and behavior.
- **Pattern Matching**: Utilizing pattern matching with enums to execute different operations.
- **User Input**: Handling user input from the command line.
- **Error Handling**: Managing potential errors during input and operations.

### 2. To-Do List

The To-Do List project is a command-line application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. It covers the following topics:

- **Structs and Methods**: Defining and implementing methods for a `Task` struct.
- **Vectors**: Using vectors to store and manage a collection of tasks.
- **UUIDs**: Generating and using UUIDs to uniquely identify tasks.
- **Date and Time**: Working with date and time using the `chrono` crate.
- **File I/O**: Saving and loading tasks from a file.
- **User Input**: Handling user input to perform various operations (add, list, mark as done, delete, search, edit, sort, filter, undo).
- **Modules**: Organizing code into modules for better structure and maintainability.

## Why These Exercises?

These exercises were designed to provide hands-on experience with Rust's core features and idiomatic practices. By working on these projects, I aimed to:

- Gain a deeper understanding of Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
- Learn how to structure and organize Rust code effectively.
- Explore Rust's powerful pattern matching and error handling capabilities.
- Practice working with external crates and managing dependencies.
- Develop practical applications that demonstrate real-world use cases of Rust.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository and follow the instructions in each project's directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rust-BasicExamples.git
cd Rust-BasicExamples
```
